# Coding the Humanities - Fall 2014

## Rationale

### Who:

- University of Amsterdam
- Sandberg Institute
- Coding the Humanities
- Augmenting Masterpieces
- Lust / LustLab
- UncInc
- Bocoup Boston
- Cast Your Art (?)
- Rijksmuseum
- City of Amsterdam (?)

(more?)

### What:

Groups of 4-6 students of the UvA and Sandberg will develop an interface that 
connects a specific location in Amsterdam to data from the Rijksmuseum API

### How:

- Guided Assignments
- Peer feedback sessions
- 3 Workshops with domain experts (academic, public, private partners)

### Why:

Technology is too often conceived as a goal in itself, rather than a mean to an 
ends. On the other hand, academic, humanities research often lacks grounding in 
real world problems and is hardly ever tested against actual demand. By bringing
humanities, coding, and design together in a project that is driven by the 
demands of an actual case holder, we believe that our students will be better 
equipped to avoid above mentioned problems.

For the students of UvA the proposed collaboration has the following benefits:

- They are introduced to design thinking and prototyping.
- They get to work with more advanced students.
- They are taught by someone who runs a world renowned design studio and lab.

For the students of Sandberg the proposed collaboration has the following benefits:

- They have the possibility to learn JavaScript
- They have the possibility have a team of interdisciplinary scholars work on 
  an project that they came up with.
- They are confronted to problems from a humanities perspective

For the partners in this project the proposed collaboration has the following benefits:

- True interdisciplinary research and teaching
- Explore the possibilities for sustainable, future collaborations
- Get into contact with talented students
- Work on the cutting edge of humanities research, design, and technology

- Use HTML and CSS to mark up and style your documentation

#### Goals of the Assignment

- Guide view from broad towards more specific.
- Convert the feeling of public participation
- Catch random flows of information
- Become aware of unused time and space
- Make new narratives

### Prepare Pitch

For the kick-off session on the fourth the Sandberg students will prepare a 
short presentation to pitch their project. As a group, we will select the 
4-6 most promising ones during the kick-off.
